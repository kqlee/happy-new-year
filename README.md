# Countdown Timer

## Instructions

- Clone down the repo
- Run `npm install` to install all of the dev dependencies
- Run `npm run build` to build the src file from ES6
- Open the `index.html` file

## Notes:

- Time spent: close to an hour to set up the repo for ES6, file structures, writing actual code, creating README.md
- Tools used: Babel to allow ES6 code to be compiled

### Improvements:
- Refactor repetitive code in startCountdown function
- Improve styling
- Reduce the amount of HTML usage, and convert to JavaScript
- Write unit tests for each function
- Add an ESLint as a style guide
